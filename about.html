                <h3>Indroduction</h3>
                <p>My husband, Jeff, and I have been together for 15 years, and married for four and a half. We have a two-year-old son named Rhett. As if having a toddler isn't chaotic enough, we also host a horde of creatures at our home:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A twelve-year-old yellow lab/golden retriever mix named Bubba</li>
                        <li>A six-year-old tri-colored basset hound named George</li>
                        <li>A four-year-old red and white basset hound named Fred</li>
                        <li>A fourteen-year-old grey and white long-haird polydactyl cat named Iris</li>
                        <li>A ten-year-old black long-haired cat named Victor, who I suspect is part Maine Coon (he's massive!)</li>
                        <li>A seven-year-old tiger cat named Cali</li>
                        <li>A six-year-old orange tabby cat named Kyle</li>
                        <li>A flock of ducks and chickens</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                Between work, school, and having a toddler, I do not have much free time for hobbies. When I do have more free time, I enjoy reading (mysteries, thrillers, and horror are my favorite), sewing, knitting, bingeing whatever show I'm currently obsessed with (right now it's Yellowjackets on Showtime), spending time outside when it's warm, travelling, and horseback riding. I participated in my school's equestrian team while completing my undergraduate degree, which allowed me to travel to Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Oklahoma to compete. It also gave me the confidence to ride a mule through the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, which is one of my favorite places to travel!

                <h4>Undergraduate</h4>
                    <p>
                        I completed my undergraduate degree at Saginaw Valley State University in Saginaw, Michigan. I graduated in 2016 and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Pyschology, minoring in Sociology.
                    </p>
                <h4>Graduate Degrees</h4>
                    <p>
                        My first graduate degree is from Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. I graduated in 2018 with a Masters in Social Work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently in my third semester at Wayne State University, working toward a Masters in Library and Information Sciences. I am specializing in Technical Services, and hope to have a long-term career in cataloging or another form of information organization. I plan to graduate at the end of the spring/summer term 2026.

                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Prior to my work in libraries, I worked in the social work field. I provided in-home and in-school substance use therapy to clients, and then worked in a children's advocacy center. When I chose to leave the social work field, I happened upon libraries by accident. I reached out to my local library, the Lake Odessa Community Library, to see if they were hiring, and started working there part-time as a Library Assistant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While working at the Lake Odessa Community Library, I realized that I wanted to make a career out of library work. In 2023, I began working as the Circulation Supervisor at the Hastings Public Library. At the beginning of 2025, I was promoted to Assistant Director at the Hastings Public Library.
